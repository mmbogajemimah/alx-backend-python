## Unittests and Integration Tests

### Overview
This project focuses on building foundational skills in **unit testing** and **integration testing** using Python. It introduces testing patterns such as mocking, parameterization, and fixtures, ensuring you can confidently verify the functionality of your code.

---

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Differentiate between **unit tests** and **integration tests**.
- Use testing patterns like:
  - **Mocking** to simulate external dependencies.
  - **Parameterization** to test multiple input cases.
  - **Fixtures** to set up and clean up resources required for tests.

---

### Key Concepts

#### **Unit Testing**
- **Definition**: Testing individual functions to ensure they return expected results for various inputs.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Tests **only the logic inside the function**.
  - Mocks are used for external calls (e.g., network, database).
  - Tests both **standard inputs** and **corner cases**.
- **Goal**: Ensure the function works as expected when external dependencies behave correctly.

#### **Integration Testing**
- **Definition**: Testing code paths **end-to-end** to validate the interaction between multiple components.
- **Characteristics**:
  - External calls (HTTP requests, database I/O) are mocked minimally.
  - Verifies interactions across the system.
- **Goal**: Ensure the complete system works together as expected.

### Execution
To run your tests, use the following command:

```bash
$ python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
```

5. [Memoization in Python](https://realpython.com/python-memoization/)

### Testing Patterns

#### **Mocking**
- Use mocks to replace external dependencies and simulate their behavior.
- Example: Mocking database calls in a unit test to avoid real I/O operations.

#### **Parameterization**
- Use parameterized tests to evaluate functions with multiple inputs.
- Example: Test a function for standard cases and edge cases using a single test definition.

#### **Fixtures**
- Define setup and teardown logic for your tests.
- Example: Use fixtures to create temporary test data or mock objects.

---

### Example Commands

Run a specific test file:
```bash
$ python -m unittest tests/test_example.py
```

Run all tests in the `tests/` directory:
```bash
$ python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Run tests with verbosity:
```bash
$ python -m unittest -v
```

---

### Best Practices
1. **Isolate logic in unit tests** by mocking external dependencies.
2. Test **standard inputs** as well as **edge cases**.
3. Use integration tests to validate **end-to-end workflows**.
4. Document tests clearly to describe the behavior being tested.
